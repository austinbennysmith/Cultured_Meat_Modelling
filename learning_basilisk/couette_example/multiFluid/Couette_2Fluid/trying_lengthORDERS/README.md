### In my original 2-fluid couette simulations, I had rhoWater and rhoOil set to 1.0 and 0.917, respectively, even though they really should be 1000 and 917. However, when I change them to 1000 and 917, I get weird instabilities in the convergence of the flow, likely due to changes to the Reynolds & Weber numbers. Here I'm playing with the Length scale to see if this fixes it. Setting the length scale to 1e-5 should yield the same results as my original simulation, and we'll see what other values do.
