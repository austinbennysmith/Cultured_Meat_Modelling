### After debugging in this subfolder for a while (such as by putting the #define We & Re in parentheses to avoid order of operations problems), I got the multicouette_REASONABLE.c file to output the expected results. I then copied it in to the parent folder (Couette_2Fluid) as multicouette.c. It will be treated as the correct one from now on.
