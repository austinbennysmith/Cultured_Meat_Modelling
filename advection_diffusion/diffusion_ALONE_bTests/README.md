### Note: in this folder, the initial condition is different than when I run the code elsewhere. Here it's a less-trivialized gaussian function than elsewhere, which made it simpler to work with variance stuff. My goal here was to see how variance increases linearly with time in the simulation, and it appears that it does, though I haven't figured out if the slopes are doing what they're supposed to do.
